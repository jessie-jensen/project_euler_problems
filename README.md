# My Project Euler Repo

This repo contains my solutions to Project Euler problems. My purpose for doing this is to become more familar and comfortable with using Python & Juypter notebooks (iPython notebooks) and solve some interesting problems along the way.


You can find [Project Euler HERE](https://projecteuler.net). My Project Euler alias is [joshua-s-jensen](https://projecteuler.net/profile/joshua-s-jensen.png).
